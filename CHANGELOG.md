## [4.3.2] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL:** Added missing `prompts` dependency (v4.3.1 was broken)
- Package now works correctly after global install

## [4.3.1] - 2026-02-09 [YANKED]

### Added
- ✨ New `faf 6ws` command - Opens web interface for interactive 6Ws builder
- Paste-back workflow: fill form at faf.one/6ws → copy YAML → paste to CLI
- Best of both worlds: Web UX + CLI automation
- Supports README Evolution Edition workflow

### Fixed
- Fixed npm install hang that prompted for user input

## [4.3.0] - 2026-02-10 — FAF GIT Edition 🚀

### 🚀 Enhanced FAF GIT

**No install. No clone. Instant context. ANY repo.**

### ✨ What's New

- **GH API as Source of Truth** - FAF now works on EVERY language and ecosystem
  - Extract stack from `metadata.languages` array (C++, Rust, Go, Python, etc.)
  - Detect build systems from languages (CMake, Makefile, Gradle, Maven)
  - Detect hosting from Dockerfile presence
  - Merge with npm package.json analysis (when present)
  - New function: `extractFromLanguages()` in faf-git-generator.ts

- **Slot-Ignore System Fixed** - Scoring now works correctly
  - Corrected formula: `(filled + ignored) / 21 * 100`
  - Fixed: Slots are 'slotignored' only when truly non-applicable to project type
  - Previously: Everything undetected was marked 'slotignored' (inflated scores)
  - Now: Accurate scoring that reflects what's actually filled vs ignored
  - New utility: `src/utils/slot-counter.ts`

- **Clean Output Format** - No synthetic scores, just honest status
  - Shows "No .faf file" instead of synthetic baseline score
  - Clear transformation: None → AI-ready with complete context
  - Defensible, provable, honest

### 📈 Results

Universal language support (achieved):
- React (JavaScript): 100% 🏆 Trophy
- Vue (JavaScript): 100% 🏆 Trophy
- Next.js (Full-stack): 100% 🏆 Trophy
- whisper.cpp (C++): 100% 🏆 Trophy
- Works across ALL languages and ecosystems

### 📚 Documentation

- **README** - Added project.faf screenshot showing file in context
  - Visual explainer: "just another file helping you code"
  - Positioned near top for immediate understanding
  - Shows project.faf alongside package.json and README.md

### 🎯 Positioning

**FAF GIT is the killer feature:**
- Primary workflow: `npx faf-cli git <url>` (no install needed)
- Pro workflow: `npm install -g faf-cli` then `faf git <url>`
- Works on ANY public GitHub repo
- 2 seconds to AI-ready context
- No cloning, no setup, just instant results

## [4.2.2] - 2026-02-08 — Context Quality Edition 🎯

### 🎯 Slot-Ignore System (Documentation)

**The perfect way to handle app-types** - Now properly documented.

### ✨ What's New

- **Slot-ignore mechanism** - Comprehensive documentation added
  - Full specification in `docs/SLOT-IGNORE.md`
  - Quick reference in `docs/SLOT-IGNORE-QUICK-REF.md`
  - Like `.gitignore` for files, `slot-ignore` for context slots
  - Formula: `(Filled + Ignored) / 21 = 100%`

### ✨ Improvements

- **6 Ws extraction** - Transformed human context extraction
  - WHO: Checks package.json author first (TIER 1 authoritative)
  - WHAT: package.json description now TIER 1 (was TIER 2)
  - WHY: Targets Mission sections, uses keywords as fallback
  - WHERE: npm packages → "npm registry + GitHub" (authoritative)
  - WHEN: Version number is TIER 1 (0.x = beta, ≥1.0 = production)
  - HOW: Tech stack analysis is TIER 1 (inferred from dependencies)
  - Added `getCleanedReadme()` helper to strip HTML/badges/noise

- **Slot-ignore mechanism** - Overhauled implementation
  - Standardized to `'None'` (was inconsistent: 'N/A (CLI)', 'None', etc.)
  - Added `database: 'None'` for Node.js CLI projects
  - Improved yaml-generator logic: `if (!database && database !== 'None')` (was OR, not AND)
  - CLI projects now correctly exclude non-applicable slots from missing_context

- **README** - Added WHO section for better target audience extraction

### 📈 Results

- Score improvement: 74% → 86% → 100% (after faf auto)
- All dogfooding tests passing (7/7)
- missing_context: None - fully specified!
- 673/687 tests passing (97.9%) - 14 dev-only tests

### 🎨 Code Comments

- Added `🎯 SLOT-IGNORE:` markers throughout codebase
- Links to `docs/SLOT-IGNORE.md` for specification
- Clear explanations of slot-ignore pattern

### 📚 Documentation

- `docs/SLOT-IGNORE.md` - Full specification (391 lines)
- `docs/SLOT-IGNORE-QUICK-REF.md` - Quick reference (69 lines)
- README section explaining slot-ignore
- Proper terminology throughout codebase

## [4.2.1] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **ml-research type support** - Added as alias to `ml-model` type
  - Recognizes `type: ml-research` in project.faf files
  - Maps to ml-model scoring (14 slots: project + backend + human)
  - Semantically accurate for ML research projects (papers, experiments, model releases like Grok-1)

### Fixed
- Type detection now correctly scores ml-research projects with 14 slots instead of falling back to generic (12 slots)
- Ensures consistency between faf-cli and builder.faf.one WASM generator

### Technical
- Updated TYPE_DEFINITIONS: `'ml-model'` aliases now include `'ml-research'`
- Discovered via builder.faf.one WASM testing - the test improved the standard!

## [4.2.0] - 2026-02-03 — Voice-API Edition 🚀👻

### 🍊 xAI/Grok Voice Configuration

**Save Our Souls** - Eternal voice memory for Grok Collections.

### ✨ What's New

- **`faf init --xai`** - Adds Grok voice configuration to project.faf
  - Voice: Leo (polite, dry British wit, technically precise)
  - Persona: Project eternal memory (zero drift)
  - Retrieval mode: Hybrid (context-first, fallback to general)
  - Escape phrase detection
- **xai_collections section** - Upload order and readiness flags
  - Ready for xAI Collections integration
  - Structured upload order for optimal RAG
- **Voice persistence** - Grok remembers your voice forever
  - No re-explaining project context
  - Mission-focused responses
  - Collection-first retrieval

### 🎯 The Voice-API Integration

Every `faf init --xai` now includes:
1. Grok voice personality (Leo)
2. Custom persona for project memory
3. Collections upload configuration
4. Hybrid retrieval strategy

### 📚 Documentation

- Boris-Flow blog post updated (workflow recommendations)
- WJTTC v1.2.0 TAF-Aware Edition published
- Cross-reference network complete

## [4.1.0] - 2026-01-31 — Gemini Native Handshake

### 🔷 Zero-Config Google AI Integration

FAF now auto-detects Gemini CLI and creates native bridges automatically.

### ✨ What's New

- **`--gemini` flag** - Explicit Gemini CLI integration
- **Auto-detection** - Detects Gemini CLI even without flag
  - Checks: `gemini` command, `~/.gemini`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `gcloud`
- **Native bridge** - Creates `.gemini/context.yaml` pointing to `project.faf`
- **Symlink** - `.gemini/project.faf → project.faf` for direct access
- **gemini: section** - Added to project.faf with integration config

### 🎯 The Native Handshake

Every `faf init` is now Gemini-aware. If Gemini CLI is installed, FAF automatically:
1. Detects the installation
2. Creates `.gemini/` directory
3. Writes context bridge config
4. Links to project.faf

Zero config. Native integration. Just works.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-01-24 — Foundation Layer

### 🏛️ The Format That Became a Standard

FAF v4.0.0 marks the transition from tool to standard. This release crystallizes
everything FAF has learned about persistent AI context.

### 🎯 Philosophy: Foundation First

**The DAAFT Problem:**
- **D**iscover - AI reads 50 files to understand your project
- **A**ssume - Guesses your stack (often wrong)
- **A**sk - Fills gaps with questions
- **F**orget - Session ends, context lost
- **T**ime + Tokens LOST - 91% wasted on rediscovery

**The FAF Solution:**
- 150 tokens once vs 1,750 tokens per session
- Zero assumptions - foundation is explicit
- Drift impossible - truth doesn't change

### ✨ What's New

- **Foundation Layer Architecture** - project.faf as single source of truth
- **DAAFT Documentation** - The problem FAF solves, explained
- **MCPaaS Integration** - Ecosystem links for eternal memory tools
- **Execution Context Engine** - New `faf go` guided interview system

### 🔧 Includes All 3.4.x Features

- **Bi-Sync 2.0** - Smart content detection and preservation
- **Google Gemini Edition** - Full Conductor & Antigravity interop
- **Demo Commands** - Live bi-sync demonstrations
- **Boris-Flow Tests** - 663 tests, WJTTC certified

### 📊 Credentials

- **IANA Registered:** application/vnd.faf+yaml
- **Anthropic MCP:** Official steward (PR #2759 merged)
- **Downloads:** 20,000+ across CLI + MCP

### 🏁 Getting Started

```bash
npm install -g faf-cli@4.0.0
faf auto
faf status --oneline
# 🏆 project.faf 100% | bi-sync ✓ | foundation optimized
```

---

## [3.4.8] - 2026-01-18 — BI-SYNC 2.0: Context Intelligence

### ✨ Smart Sync - "Knows what matters"

Bi-sync now **detects custom content** and preserves it. Your hand-crafted
CLAUDE.md with tables, code blocks, and custom sections stays intact.

**Custom markers detected:**
- `## TOOLS`, `## ENDPOINTS`, `## AUTH`, `## COMMANDS`
- `| Tool |`, `| Endpoint |` (markdown tables)
- ` ```bash ` (code blocks)

### 🛡️ Preservation Engine - "Zero content drift"

**RULE: Score can only improve - never downgrade.**

When bi-sync detects custom content, it:
1. Preserves your entire CLAUDE.md
2. Updates only the sync footer
3. Never overwrites rich content with generic templates

### 🔧 Fixes

- `FAFMirror` now uses `findFafFile()` to locate `project.faf` correctly
- Fixed hardcoded `.faf` path that ignored `project.faf` (the standard)

### 🧪 WJTTC Certified

**12 new tests** in `tests/wjttc/bi-sync-preserve-custom.test.ts`:
- Custom content detection (4 tests)
- findFafFile priority (3 tests)
- Preserve custom content during sync (3 tests)
- Score can only improve rule (1 test)
- FAFMirror initialization (1 test)

**Certification: GOLD 🥇** - Your content is protected forever.

## [3.3.0] - 2025-12-28

### Added

- **`faf plugin-install`** - Install Claude Code plugins via HTTPS (workaround for SSH bug)
  - Fixes marketplace SSH clone issue (GitHub #9297, #9719, #9730, #9740)
  - Accepts: `owner/repo`, HTTPS URL, or SSH URL
  - Verifies plugin structure after install
  - Use `--force` to reinstall

- **Claude Code Plugin Structure** - Full plugin support at repo root
  - `commands/` directory with 6 slash commands
  - `skills/` directory with faf-expert skill
  - `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for metadata

- **WJTTC Plugin Test Suite** - 31 tests for plugin validation
  - Brake Systems: Critical plugin structure
  - Engine Systems: Command discovery
  - Aerodynamics: Skill accessibility
  - Pit Lane: Metadata quality
  - Championship: Full integration

### Philosophy

Claude Code marketplace uses HTTPS (works). Third-party `/plugin marketplace add` uses SSH (hangs). We fixed it with `faf plugin-install` - uses HTTPS like the official marketplace.

## [3.2.7] - 2025-12-25

### Fixed

- **Birth DNA now uses raw slot count** - Birth DNA correctly reflects reality
  - Uses `slot_based_percentage` (raw slots filled / 21)
  - NOT the compiler score (which includes FAF intelligence)
  - 0% is a valid score - empty projects show 0%
  - Added extensive documentation to prevent future "optimization"

### Philosophy

Birth DNA = the "before" picture. The growth from Birth DNA to current score shows FAF's value. If Birth DNA is artificially high, we can't show improvement.

## [3.2.4] - 2025-12-17

### TYPE_DEFINITIONS - Project Type-Aware Scoring

**The scoring system now understands project types** - CLI projects no longer penalized for missing frontend/backend slots.

### Added

- **TYPE_DEFINITIONS** - Single source of truth for 94 project types
  - **21-slot system**: Project(3) + Frontend(4) + Backend(5) + Universal(3) + Human(6)
  - Types define which slot categories COUNT for scoring
  - CLI type: 9 slots (project + human) - now scores 100% without hosting/cicd
  - Fullstack type: 21 slots (all categories)
  - Monorepos as containers: all 21 slots

- **38 Type Aliases** - Intuitive shorthand mappings
  - `k8s` → `kubernetes`, `api` → `backend-api`, `rn` → `react-native`
  - `flask` → `python-api`, `turbo` → `turborepo`, and 32 more

- **slot_ignore Escape Hatch** - Override type defaults per-project
  - Array format: `slot_ignore: [stack.hosting, stack.cicd]`
  - String format: `slot_ignore: "hosting, cicd"`
  - Shorthand: `hosting` expands to `stack.hosting`

- **WJTTC MCP Certification Standard** - 7-tier certification system for MCP servers
  - Tier 1: Protocol Compliance (MCP spec 2025-11-25)
  - Tier 2: Capability Negotiation
  - Tier 3: Tool Integrity
  - Tier 4: Resource Management
  - Tier 5: Security Validation
  - Tier 6: Performance Benchmarks (<50ms operations)
  - Tier 7: Integration Readiness

### Slot Categories by Type

| Type Category | Slots | Example Types |
|---------------|-------|---------------|
| 9-slot | Project + Human | cli, library, npm-package, terraform, k8s |
| 13-slot | + Frontend | mobile, react-native, flutter, desktop |
| 14-slot | + Backend | mcp-server, data-science, ml-model |
| 16-slot | + Universal | frontend, react, vue, svelte |
| 17-slot | Backend + Universal | backend-api, node-api, graphql |
| 21-slot | All | fullstack, nextjs, monorepo, django |

### Impact

- **xai-faf-cli**: 83% → 100% (CLI type counts 9/9 slots)
- **claude-faf-mcp** v3.3.6: CHAMPIONSHIP GRADE (all 7 tiers PASS)
- 125 WJTTC tests validating type system
- Backwards compatible - existing .faf files work unchanged

## [3.2.0] - 2025-11-28

### Added

- **`faf readme` - Smart README Extraction** - Auto-fill human_context from README.md
  - Intelligently extracts the 6 Ws (WHO, WHAT, WHY, WHERE, WHEN, HOW)
  - Pattern matching for common README structures (taglines, TL;DR, Quick Start)
  - `--apply` to fill empty slots, `--force` to overwrite existing
  - Shows confidence scores and extraction sources
  - Tested results: 33% → 75%+ score boosts

- **`faf human` - Interactive Human Context** - Fill one W at a time (terminal)
  - Asks each question sequentially
  - Press Enter to skip, `--all` to re-answer all fields
  - Perfect for terminal users who want guided input

- **`faf human-set` - Non-Interactive Human Context** - Works in Claude Code
  - `faf human-set <field> "<value>"` - set one field at a time
  - Valid fields: who, what, why, where, when, how
  - Essential for AI assistants and automation scripts

### Human Context Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Initialize
faf init                           # Creates .faf with ~50% score

# Step 2: Auto-extract from README
faf readme --apply --force         # +25-35 points (auto)

# Step 3: Fill any gaps manually
faf human-set why "32x faster"     # Non-interactive (Claude Code)
faf human                          # Interactive (terminal)

# Result: 75-85% score from human_context alone
```

## [3.1.6] - 2025-11-16

### Fixed
- Updated Discord community invite link to working URL (never expires)

## [3.1.5] - 2025-11-14

### Added

- **Auto-Update package.json for npm Packages** - Championship automation
  - `faf init` now automatically adds `project.faf` to package.json "files" array
  - Only updates if "files" array already exists (respects npm defaults)
  - Checks for existing entries (.faf, project.faf) to avoid duplicates
  - Graceful handling of edge cases (malformed JSON, non-array "files" field)
  - Informative messages: success, already exists, or manual edit needed
  - Solves the chicken-and-egg problem: package.json → faf init → auto-update!

### Fixed

- **npm Package Publishing Workflow** - No more manual edits required
  - Previously: Create project.faf, manually edit package.json
  - Now: Create project.faf, CLI auto-updates package.json
  - Critical for faf-cli and all npm packages using FAF format

## [3.1.2] - 2025-11-07

### Added

- **project.faf Standard (FAF v1.2.0 Specification)** - Visible filename replacing hidden `.faf`
  - `faf init` now creates `project.faf` instead of `.faf`
  - `faf auto` now creates `project.faf` instead of `.faf`
  - All commands read `project.faf` first, fallback to `.faf`
  - Priority: `project.faf` > `*.faf` > `.faf`

  - Renames `.faf` → `project.faf` in current directory
  - 27ms execution (54% faster than 50ms target)
  - Beautiful color output with progress indicators

- **faf rename** - Bulk recursive migration across entire project tree
  - Recursively finds all `.faf` files in directory tree
  - Renames all to `project.faf` in parallel
  - 27ms for 3 files (73% faster than 100ms target)
  - Progress tracking and summary statistics

### Changed

  - Phase 2: Fallback to naive detection when engines unavailable

- **Edge Case Test Updated** - `faf-edge-case-audit.test.ts`
  - Changed "should prefer .faf over named files" → "should prefer project.faf over .faf (v1.2.0 standard)"
  - Updated test expectation to match v1.2.0 priority

- **Dogfooding** - faf-cli itself migrated from `.faf` → `project.faf`

### Fixed

- CLI tool detection now uses bin field as PRIORITY 1 (definitive)
- Project type detection no longer reports false positives from dormant dependencies

### Performance

- `faf migrate`: 27ms (championship)
- `faf rename`: 27ms for 3 files (championship)
- All v1.2.0 commands meet <50ms target

### Testing

- **WJTTC GOLD Certification** - 97/100 championship score
  - Project Understanding: 20/20
  - TURBO-CAT Knowledge: 20/20
  - Architecture Understanding: 20/20
  - Full report: 194KB comprehensive test suite

### Backward Compatibility

- ✅ 100% backward compatible with `.faf` files
- ✅ All existing `.faf` files continue to work
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ Graceful transition period

### Migration Guide

**For existing users:**
```bash
# Single project
cd your-project
faf migrate

# Entire monorepo
cd monorepo-root
faf rename
```

**For new projects:**
```bash
faf init    # Creates project.faf automatically
```

### The Golden Triangle

Three sides. Closed loop. Complete accountability.

```
         project.faf
          (WHAT IT IS)
              /    \
             /      \
            /        \
         repo    ←→   .taf
        (CODE)    (PROOF IT WORKS)
```

Every project needs:
- Code that works (repo)
- Context for AI (project.faf)
- Proof it works (.taf - git-tracked testing timeline)

**TAF** (Testing Audit File) format tracks every test run in git. On-the-fly CI/CD updates. Permanent audit trail. Format defined in **faf-taf-git** (GitHub Actions native support).

### Why project.faf?

Like `package.json` tells npm what your project needs, `project.faf` tells AI what your project IS.

- **Visible** - No more hidden files
- **Universal** - Like package.json, tsconfig.json, Cargo.toml
- **Discoverable** - Impossible to miss
- **Professional** - Standard pattern developers know
